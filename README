# PhD_projects
This is a folder containing a mixture of scripts that I have written through my current post as a PhD student at the Vajda lab @Boston University to serve as a snapshot of my current work.
Some are well commented than others and some are just modules and or helper class for bigger programs written with collaborators. 
Slowly, I hope to organize these scripts into their respective projects so that people in the lab and those interested can use them either for data processing or more.
